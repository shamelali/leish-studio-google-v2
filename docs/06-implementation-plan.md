## 0. Guiding Strategy

The product is feature-rich but **its core funnel is broken in three independent ways** (booking validation, auth headers, ephemeral storage). The plan front-loads correctness, then unlocks the already-built AI surfaces, then hardens for launch.

```
 Phase 0  STOP THE BLEEDING     booking works · auth writes work · errors visible
 Phase 1  MAKE IT TRUSTWORTHY    authz · persistence · locale · secrets · tests/CI
 Phase 2  UNLOCK WHAT'S BUILT    mount/remove orphan AI studios · routing · perf
 Phase 3  POLISH & LAUNCH        background-scheme migration · a11y · content truth
 Phase 4  GROW                   analytics · SEO ·Workspace · payments discovery
```

**Estimate unit:** engineer-days (single full-stack engineer unless noted). Totals are nominal, not padded.

## Phase 0 — Stop the Bleeding  (P0 · ~4 days · ship immediately)

> Goal: a guest can complete a booking, and a provider/client can actually manage it.

| # | Task | Files | Days | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | **Fix booking date regex** `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}RM` → `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` | `server.ts:102` | 0.1 | `POST /api/bookings` with `2026-10-08` returns 201 |
| 0.2 | **Surface booking errors** — replace `catch { console.error }` with inline banner + retry; show success confirmation state | `BookingModal.tsx` | 0.4 | Failed submit shows actionable message; success shows confirmation |
| 0.3 | **Fix markdown-fence stripping** `` /\s*```RM/ `` → strip trailing ```` ``` ```` fences | `server.ts:836,838` | 0.1 | Fenced Gemini JSON parses; lookbook returns `source: model` |
| 0.4 | **Fix ID template literals** (3 sites): `${Math.random()}.toString(36)...}` → `${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2,8)}` | `server.ts:156,401,465` | 0.2 | New IDs match `^[a-z]+-\w{8,}$` |
| 0.5 | **Audit whole `server.ts` for the same corruption signature** (`}` replacing `.`) | `server.ts` | 0.3 | grep report clean; no other malformed literals |
| 0.6 | **Add `Authorization` to all authenticated writes** — route through `src/lib/api.ts` | `ClientPortal.tsx:75`, `ProviderDashboard.tsx:123/142/172/188`, `ProfileModal.tsx:70` | 0.8 | Cancel, status change, service CRUD, profile edit all succeed when signed in |
| 0.7 | **Per-call error + success feedback** on those mutations (toast or inline), no silent failure | same files | 0.6 | Every mutation shows outcome |
| 0.8 | **Regression test** for the booking funnel: supertest happy path + 400 + 401 | new `server.test.ts` | 0.6 | Green in CI (wire-up in 1.9) |
| 0.9 | **Manual E2E pass** of the two core journeys (§Flow 4 & 9) | — | 0.5 | Both journeys complete on desktop + mobile viewport |
| 0.10 | Hotfix deploy + smoke test | Vercel | 0.3 | Production booking succeeds |

**Exit criteria:** core funnel works end-to-end in production; zero silent failures on user-facing writes.

### Phase 0 status (2026-10-08)

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Booking date regex | ✅ fixed (commit `412036d`) |
| 0.2 | Visible booking errors (`submitError` banner + `getValues` crash fix) | ✅ fixed (`412036d`) |
| 0.3 | Markdown-fence stripping → `stripJsonFences()` | ✅ fixed + test-covered |
| 0.4 | ID template literals (3 sites) | ✅ fixed — verified live: `book-1791395804519-8it8ng` |
| 0.5 | Corruption audit across repo | ✅ exactly 7 sites, all in `server.ts`, all fixed |
| 0.6 | `Authorization` on authenticated writes | ✅ all 6 call sites via `lib/api.ts`; PATCH verified 200 with `authorization` header |
| 0.7 | Per-call error/success feedback | ✅ wired to existing `error` banners in ClientPortal / ProviderDashboard |
| 0.8 | Regression suite | ✅ `server.test.ts` — 17 tests green (`npm test`), isolated via `LEISH_DB_PATH` |
| 0.9 | Manual E2E, both journeys | ✅ desktop viewport — see findings below |
| 0.10 | Hotfix deploy + smoke | ⏳ pending (Vercel routing work landed in `5a10e45`) |

**Two additional defects found during E2E and fixed (not in the original audit):**
- **§9.10 plaintext passwords** — the persisted `db_store.json` predates bcrypt, so *every* login 401'd against the real store. Fixed with `DataStore.normalizePasswords()` (re-hash on load) + migration test. **Requires a server restart to take effect on existing stores.**
- **§9.11 booking date off-by-one** — UTC vs. local mismatch stored the previous day's date for bookings made 00:00–08:00 GMT+8. Fixed with local date-part formatting.

**Journey results:** ① guest browse → detail → 3-step booking → `POST /api/bookings` **201**, confirmation with well-formed receipt, no error banner. ② provider demo login **200** → Salon Portal → Accept → `PATCH …/status` **200** with JWT → status `CONFIRMED` in UI.

**E2E environment note:** automated browser runs need a *visible* tab — with the document `visibilityState: 'hidden'`, `requestAnimationFrame` never fires, so `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` never completes its exit handshake and multi-step flows stall on step 1 (an environment artifact, not an app defect). For CI, run Playwright headed or with `prefers-reduced-motion` + a transition-free config.

## Phase 1 — Make It Trustworthy  (P0/P1 · ~12 days)

### 1A · Security & Authorization (~4 days)

| # | Task | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Ownership middleware** (`requireSalonOwner`, `requireBookingAccess`) implementing TR-7; apply to `PUT /salons/:id`, service CRUD, `PATCH /bookings/:id/status` | Provider A cannot mutate Provider B's salon (403); client can cancel own booking only |
| 1.2 | **Lock down reads:** `GET /bookings` requires JWT and scopes by `email`/`salonId`; `GET /auth/demo-accounts` returns only demo accounts or is removed | Unauthenticated booking enumeration returns 401 |
| 1.3 | **Gate review creation:** require auth + a completed booking for that email | Review bombing impossible |
| 1.4 | **`JWT_SECRET` fail-fast** when `NODE_ENV=production` and unset (TR-9); remove dev fallback | Boot crashes with clear message in prod without secret |
| 1.5 | **Rotate & de-commit secrets:** Firebase web key, Maps key in `InteractiveMap.tsx:37` + `.env.example`; move Maps key to `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with HTTP referrer restrictions | `git grep AIza` returns only env references |
| 1.6 | **Rate-limit buckets** (`auth` / `read` / `ai`) (TR-8); re-enable Helmet CSP in production | AI burst doesn't block login; CSP header present in prod |
| 1.7 | **Demo password handling:** show demo credentials only via a build-time constant, never list real users | `demo-accounts` endpoint contains no real user PII |

### 1B · Data Durability (~4 days)

| # | Task | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 1.8.1 | Define a `DataStore` **interface** matching current usage; keep JSON impl as the test/dev fallback (TR-2) | App boots with either backend via `STORE_BACKEND` env |
| 1.8.2 | **Firestore implementation** using Firebase Admin SDK; collections `salons`, `bookings`, `reviews`, `users` per `firebase-blueprint.json`; parity rules with `firestore.rules` | Round-trip tests green against emulator |
| 1.8.3 | **Idempotent seed/migration:** run only when empty; never destructive re-seed on existing data | Deploy #2 preserves data from deploy #1 |
| 1.8.4 | Client reads for catalog via API (unchanged) — Firestore stays server-side only; keep deny-by-default rules | `firestore.rules` deployed and verified |
| 1.8.5 | Booked-indexes + query plan: `bookings.byEmail`, `bookings.bySalon`, `reviews.bySalon` | Portal queries use indexes, no full scans |
| 1.8.6 | Remove `/tmp/db_store.json` path and the "Firestore Live" decorative badge → real health indicator | Badge reflects actual backend status |

### 1C · Locale, Content Truth & Config (~2 days)

| # | Task | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 1.9 | **Currency → RM everywhere:** map pins, travel fee, booking summary, JSON-LD (`index.html` USD → MYR), copy | `grep -r '\$' src/` shows no prices; no `USD` in structured data |
| 1.10 | **Distance → km;** replace hash-pseudo-distance with `google.maps.geometry` / Geocoding API distance matrix (server-side call) | Venue quote returns real km + RM fee |
| 1.11 | **Derive hero stats from data** (verified MUAs, ateliers counts) | Numbers change when listings change |
| 1.12 | **Remove decorative claims** ("Cloud SQL eligibility verified") or back them with live checks | No unbacked badges |
| 1.13 | **Reconcile fonts:** load exactly the families `@theme` declares (or re-point tokens to loaded families); drop unused `--font-display` or use it | No silent `system-ui` fallback for serif/mono |
| 1.14 | **Split rate-limit buckets + AI timeout contract** (TR-3): `{source, data}` envelope on all `/gemini/*` | UI can render a "sample result" chip |

### 1D · Quality Gates (~2 days)

| # | Task | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 1.15 | **API integration suite** (vitest + supertest): every endpoint, incl. the 401/403 matrix from 1.1–1.3 | Coverage of all 28 routes |
| 1.16 | **ESLint + Prettier** config; fix violations; rename package `react-example` → `leish-marketplace` | `npm run lint` = tsc + eslint, both clean |
| 1.17 | **CI pipeline** (GitHub Actions or Vercel checks): typecheck → lint → tests → build (TR-12) | PRs blocked on failure |
| 1.18 | **Playwright smoke:** guest book flow + provider confirm flow | Runs in CI on every PR |

**Exit criteria:** secure, durable, tested, locale-correct; deploy survives redeploy with data intact.

---

## Phase 2 — Unlock What's Already Built  (P1/P2 · ~9 days)

| # | Task | Days | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | **Decision gate:** mount or remove `ImageStudio`, `VeoVideoStudio`, `GeminiChatbot` (they're complete but unmounted) | 0.2 | Written decision in PRD §Open Questions |
| 2.2a | *(if mounting)* add "Studio" nav group + lazy routes; wire chatbot as a global assistant entry | 2.0 | Reachable in ≤2 clicks; code-split |
| 2.2b | *(if removing)* delete components + unused `/gemini/generate-*` / `chat` endpoints and tests | 0.5 | No dead exports |
| 2.3 | **URL-backed routing** (TR-1): `/`, `/listing/:id`, `/lookbook`, `/advisor`, `/workspace`, `/bookings`, `/portal/:section`; migrate the Zustand tab machine with redirects; back/forward works | 3.0 | Detail page URL is shareable; refresh preserves view |
| 2.4 | **Code-splitting:** `React.lazy` per route, vendor chunk splitting; target initial JS < 350 KB gzip | 1.0 | Lighthouse performance ≥ 80 mobile |
| 2.5 | **Single HTTP client** (TR-4): typed `api.ts` generated from shared zod schemas; delete raw `fetch` remnants | 1.5 | Zero raw fetches in components; client/server schemas cannot drift |
| 2.6 | **Adopt or delete orphans** (TR-6): `design-tokens.ts` (regenerate from `@theme` or remove), `forms.ts` (adopt as schema home), `useAuth.ts` | 1.0 | No unreferenced src modules |
| 2.7 | **Hero-image state unification** (TR-5): one source (store + persist) | 0.3 | No competing `localStorage` reads |
| 2.8 | **Search debounce + query polish** (`placeholderData`, empty states) | 0.5 | Typing doesn't re-render grid per keystroke |
| 2.9 | **Workspace token persistence:** refresh-token rotation or explicit re-auth UX | 1.5 | Reload doesn't silently drop Google session |

**Exit criteria:** every built feature is reachable or deliberately cut; app is fast, shareable, and type-safe end-to-end.

---

## Phase 3 — Polish & Launch  (P1 · ~7 days)

| # | Task | Days | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | **Background-scheme migration** (doc 05 §8): add rung tokens + utilities (`bg-panel-gradient`, `bg-scrim-*`, `glow-orb`); convert screens in order Hero → Lookbook → Portals → modals → grids → Workspace | 2.5 | `grep -r 'bg-\[#' src` only returns approved values; visual diff reviewed |
| 3.2 | **Contrast + a11y pass:** re-verify gold-tint panels, focus rings, `aria-*`, keyboard nav, `prefers-reduced-motion` | 1.5 | axe-core zero serious issues on main routes |
| 3.3 | **Copy & voice pass** per design brief §10 (serif headlines, mono labels, RM, actionable errors) | 1.0 | Copy checklist signed off |
| 3.4 | **Imagery pass:** consistent aspect boxes, `loading="lazy"`, warm-grade consistency, alt text | 1.0 | CLS < 0.1; all listing images have alt |
| 3.5 | **Responsive QA:** 360 / 768 / 1280 across all 6 views + 3 modals | 0.5 | No horizontal scroll; booking flow thumb-usable |
| 3.6 | **Loading/empty/error states** finalized (doc 03 §11), skeletons for grids & AI | 0.5 | No layout jump on load |
| 3.7 | **Launch runbook:** env vars checklist, `JWT_SECRET` rotation, seed data, rollback plan, monitoring (Vercel logs + error boundary reporting) | 0.5 | Rehearsed deploy + rollback |

**Exit criteria:** PRD §12 Release Criteria all green.

---

## Phase 4 — Grow  (P2/P3 · backlog, unscheduled)

- **Analytics & funnel instrumentation** (search → detail → booking → confirm; AI fallback rate) to measure PRD §7.
- **SEO:** per-listing routes (2.3) + Server-rendered meta/OG for listing pages; Schema.org `BeautySalon`/`Service` with correct `priceCurrency: MYR`.
- **Verification badges** (manual ops flow) and admin surface (`role: admin`).
- **Google Workspace hub hardening** (P2/P3 features: Docs/Forms/Tasks write flows, appointment confirmation emails via Gmail).
- **Real availability:** time-slot grid from `workingHours` + existing bookings (currently free-text time).
- **Payments/deposits discovery** (v2 scoping — requires ledger, KYC, cancellation policy).
- **Reviews trust:** photo reviews, provider responses, abuse reporting.
- **PWA/offline shell** for mobile-first Klang Valley audience.

## Risks & Mitigations (plan-level)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Firestore migration slips → Phase 1 blocked | Data durability | DataStore interface (1.8.1) ships first; JSON backend stays usable, migration continues behind it |
| Mounting the 3 orphan studios expands scope | Schedule | Decision gate 2.1 with a hard default: *remove* if undecided by end of Week 3 |
| Single engineer, 32 days | Timeline | Phase 0 + 1D are parallelizable (server vs. client); 2 engineers → 3.5 weeks |
| Concurrent edits to `server.ts` (bad-replace corruption pattern already seen) | Regressions | Phase 0.5 audit + integration tests (0.8) before further feature work |
| Secrets rotation breaks live integrations | Downtime | Rotate Maps/Firebase keys in staging first; referrer-restrict before removing fallbacks |
| Design migration (3.1) introduces visual regressions | Quality | Per-screen visual diff review; grep gate; screen-by-screen order |

---
